Short-Term Goals (STG):
- Pt will perform bed mobility with Indep using appropriate sequencing and safety strategies.
- Pt will perform transfers bed from/to chair/toilet with Indep using appropriate AD and safe mechanics.
(within a total of 4 visits)

Long-Term Goals (LTG):
- Pt will ambulate 150 ft with FWW with Indep to improve household mobility and reduce fall risk.
- Pt/CG will be independent with HEP and fall-prevention strategies with safe technique and pacing.
- Pt will improve Tinetti Poma score to 20/28 or more to decrease fall risk.
(within a total of 7 visits)

Frequency: 1w1, 2w3
Assessment Summary: The patient presents with generalized weakness and impaired mobility following hospitalization for pneumonia. There is a significant decline in strength and endurance, affecting the ability to perform transfers and ambulate safely. Family reports multiple near-falls at home, highlighting a high fall risk. Skilled home health physical therapy is necessary to address deficits in strength, balance, gait, and functional mobility. Interventions will focus on improving safety with activities of daily living and facilitating a return to prior level of function. The patient's history and clinical presentation warrant ongoing skilled intervention.
